# NeoNextion

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DanNixon/NeoNextion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DanNixon/NeoNextion)
[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

An Arduino library for the
[Nextion](http://wiki.iteadstudio.com/Nextion_HMI_Solution) line of displays.

The code is heavily based on the [official
library](https://github.com/itead/ITEADLIB_Arduino_Nextion) but aims to be
cleaner, more user friendly and with a bit of luck, faster.

Available through the library manager of the Arduio IDE as `NeoNextion`.

## New features

I don't use Nextion displays in my projects anymore so this library may not
allow all the features in the latest display firmware to be used. However
I still own a few of them and am happy to work on adding new functionality
if it is desired.

If you find a feature that is missing that you want implemented let me know
and I'll look at adding it for you.
