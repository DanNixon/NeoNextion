# NeoNextion

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DanNixon/NeoNextion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DanNixon/NeoNextion)

An Arduino library for the
[Nextion](http://wiki.iteadstudio.com/Nextion_HMI_Solution) line of displays.

The code is heavily based on the [official
library](https://github.com/itead/ITEADLIB_Arduino_Nextion) but aims to be
cleaner, more user friendly and with a bit of luck, faster.

Avaliable through the library manager of the Arduio IDE as `NeoNextion`.
